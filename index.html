            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements
                    on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on
                    a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                    provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                    manipulations on a server.
                </li>

                    Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the

            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                JavaScript
                code: <br>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
                </code> <br> <br>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.

                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters
                can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A"
                through
                "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.</p>

        <!-- Section 5 -->
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                With the keyword var. For example, <br>
                <code>
                var x = 42
                </code> <br>
                This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                By simply assigning it a value. For example, <br>
                <code>
                    x = 42
                </code> <br>
                This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                variant.
                With the keyword let. For example, <br>
                <code>
                    let y = 13.
                </code>
            </p>
        </section>
        <!-- Section 6 -->
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <p> When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
                is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
                within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
                following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is
                declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement. <br>
                <code>
                    if (true) {var x = 5;} console.log(x); //5
                </code> <br>
                This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015. <br>
                <code>
                    if (true) {let y = 5;} console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
                </code>
            </p>
        </section>
        <!-- Section 7 -->
        <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <p>
                Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window,
                so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

                Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
                frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared
                in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
            </p>
        </section>
        <!-- Section 8 -->
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is
                the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can
                contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters. <br>
                <code>
                    const PI = 3.14;
                </code> <br>
                A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has
                to be initialized to a value. <br>

                The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword
                is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable. <br>

                You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                example: <br>
                <code>
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                    WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                    //statements } 
                </code> <br>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
                <br>
                <code>
                    const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
            "otherValue";
                </code>
            </p>
        </section>
        <!-- Section 9 -->
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>Data types</header>
            <p>
                The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is
                            not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. A 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String."Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
            Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with
            your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think
            of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
